React Hooks

Prerequisites

> Functional and class componenets, props, state, etc.

What are Hooks?
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. 
They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
Ex. State of a componenet

Hooks don't work inside classes

Why Hooks?

Reason Set 1
Understand how 'this' keywords in JavaScript
Remember to bind event handlers in class componenets
Classes don't minify very well and make hot reloading very unrealiable

Reason Set 2
There is no particular way to reuse stateful component logic
HOC and render props patterns do address this problem
Make the code harder to follow
There is need to share stateful logic in a better way

Reason Set 3
Create componenets for complex scenarios such as data fetching and suscribing to events
Related code is not organized in one place
Ex. Data Fetching - In componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate
Ex. Event listeners - In componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount
Because stateful logic - Cannot break componenets into smaller ones


Noteworthy Hooks
To use hooks React version 16.8 or higher needed
Completely opt in
Hooks don't contain any breaking changes and the release is 100% backwards-compatible.
Classes won't be removed from React 
Can't use Hooks inside of a class component
Hooks don't replace your knowledge of React concepts
Instead, Hooks provide a more direct API of the React concepts you already know


Summary
Hooks are a new feature addition in React version 16.8
They allow you to use React features without having to write a class
Avoid the whole confusion with 'this' keyword
Allow you to reuse stateful logic
Organize the logic inside a component into reusable isolated units


Rules of Hooks
"Only call Hooks at the Top Level"
=> Don't call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions

"Only Call Hooks from React Functions"
=> Call them from within React functional components and not just any regular JavaScript function



useEffect 
=> The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in functional componenets
=> It is a close replacement for componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount


useReducer
useReducer is a hook that is used for state management
it is alternative to useState
useState is built using useReducer

Hooks so far 
useState - state
useEffect - side effects 
useContext - context API
useReducer - reducers


reduce vs useReducer

reduce in JavaScript
array.reduce(reducer, initialValue)
singleValue = reducer(accumlator, itemValue)
reduce methods returns a single value 

useReducer in JavaScript
useReducer(reducer, initialState)
newState = reducer(currentState, action)
useRducer returns a pair of values.
[newState, dispatch]
